# General Knowledge about Knee Osteoarthritis

Q: What is osteoarthritis?  
A: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive cartilage loss and bone changes causing pain and stiffness.

Q: Which joints are most commonly affected?  
A: The knees, hips, spine, and small hand joints are most often involved.

Q: What are the major risk factors for knee OA?  
A: Age, obesity, female sex, prior injury, repetitive joint stress, and genetics.

Q: How does obesity contribute to OA?  
A: It increases joint load and inflammation, accelerating cartilage breakdown.

Q: What are the early symptoms of knee OA?  
A: Intermittent pain, mild stiffness after rest, and occasional swelling.

Q: What imaging method is used first for OA?  
A: X-rays are typically used to detect joint space narrowing and osteophytes.

Q: What is crepitus?  
A: A grating or cracking sound when moving the knee, caused by rough cartilage surfaces.

Q: Can OA be cured?  
A: No, but symptoms can be managed and progression slowed with treatment.

Q: How is knee OA graded?  
A: Using the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) system, from grade 0 (none) to 4 (severe).

Q: What is KL grade 4?  
A: Severe OA with marked narrowing, sclerosis, and deformity.

Q: What lifestyle changes help OA?  
A: Weight loss, exercise, supportive footwear, and avoiding high-impact activities.

Q: How can exercise help OA?  
A: Strengthens muscles around the knee and reduces joint stress.

Q: What are common non-surgical treatments?  
A: Painkillers, NSAIDs, physiotherapy, braces, and injections.

Q: When is surgery considered?  
A: When pain and disability persist despite conservative management.

Q: What is total knee replacement?  
A: Surgical replacement of damaged joint surfaces with artificial components.

Q: Can cold or warm therapy help?  
A: Yes. Warm compresses relax muscles; cold reduces swelling.

Q: Does weather affect OA pain?  
A: Some people report worse pain in cold or humid conditions.

Q: Is OA hereditary?  
A: It can run in families due to genetic and anatomical factors.

Q: What is subchondral sclerosis?  
A: Hardening of bone beneath cartilage seen in OA X-rays.

Q: What is the role of physiotherapy?  
A: Improves movement, reduces pain, and strengthens supporting muscles.

Q: What foods are good for joint health?  
A: Omega-3 fatty acids, fresh fruits, and vitamin D-rich foods.

Q: Are glucosamine supplements effective?  
A: Evidence is mixed; may help mild OA in some people.

Q: Can OA lead to disability?  
A: Yes, severe OA can limit mobility and daily activity.

Q: What age group gets OA most often?  
A: Adults over 45, especially women after menopause.

Q: Can injury cause OA?  
A: Yes, post-traumatic OA can follow ligament or meniscus injury.

Q: What’s the role of cartilage in joints?  
A: It cushions bones and allows smooth movement.

Q: Can strengthening exercises reduce knee pain?  
A: Yes, particularly quadriceps and hamstring strengthening.

Q: What are osteophytes?  
A: Bone spurs that develop along joint margins.

Q: Can walking worsen OA?  
A: No, moderate walking actually helps maintain function.

Q: Can OA affect both knees?  
A: Yes, though one knee is often worse due to load asymmetry.

Q: What are common complications after knee surgery?  
A: Infection, stiffness, and implant loosening.

Q: Can braces delay knee replacement?  
A: In mild OA, off-loading braces can reduce pain and delay surgery.

Q: Are women more prone to OA?  
A: Yes, especially postmenopausal women.

Q: Does OA affect sleep?  
A: Yes, chronic pain can cause sleep disturbance.

Q: Can stress worsen OA pain?  
A: Stress may heighten pain perception but does not directly cause OA.

Q: Are high heels bad for knees?  
A: Yes, they increase pressure on the knee joint.

Q: Can swimming help OA?  
A: Yes, it’s low-impact and strengthens muscles without stressing joints.

Q: Can cycling worsen OA?  
A: No, cycling helps maintain knee flexibility and strength.

Q: How long does a knee implant last?  
A: Typically 15–20 years, depending on activity level and weight.

Q: Can physiotherapy alone treat OA?  
A: It helps relieve symptoms but cannot reverse cartilage loss.

Q: What’s the difference between OA and rheumatoid arthritis?  
A: OA is degenerative; RA is autoimmune and inflammatory.

Q: Is OA an inflammatory disease?  
A: It’s primarily mechanical, but mild inflammation is common.

Q: What are subchondral cysts?  
A: Fluid-filled bone cavities seen on X-ray near the joint.

Q: How does cartilage get nutrients?  
A: Through diffusion from synovial fluid since it lacks blood supply.

Q: What is joint effusion?  
A: Accumulation of excess fluid within the knee joint capsule.

Q: Can supplements slow OA?  
A: Evidence is limited, but vitamin D and omega-3 may help.

Q: Can OA progress even with treatment?  
A: It can, but progression can often be slowed significantly.

Q: How can posture affect OA?  
A: Poor posture increases uneven joint loading, accelerating wear.

Q: Are men or women more affected?  
A: Women more commonly, due to hormonal and anatomical factors.

Q: Can OA cause leg length difference?  
A: Severe deformity or surgery may cause mild differences.

Q: What is chondrocyte function?  
A: These cells maintain and repair cartilage matrix.

Q: Can OA be prevented?  
A: Not fully, but maintaining healthy weight and activity helps.

Q: What global population is affected by OA?  
A: Over 500 million people worldwide live with OA.

Q: What’s the goal of OA treatment?  
A: Relieve pain, maintain mobility, and improve life quality.
