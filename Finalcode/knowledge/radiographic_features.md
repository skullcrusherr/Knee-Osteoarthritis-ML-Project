# Radiographic & Diagnostic Features of Knee Osteoarthritis

Q: What are classic radiographic signs of OA?  
A: Joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts.

Q: What causes joint space narrowing on X-rays?  
A: Loss of articular cartilage between femur and tibia.

Q: What are osteophytes?  
A: Bone spurs forming along joint margins due to bone remodeling.

Q: What is subchondral sclerosis?  
A: Hardening and whitening of bone beneath cartilage from stress.

Q: What is a subchondral cyst?  
A: A small fluid-filled cavity within the bone caused by microfracture and fluid intrusion.

Q: How is OA severity graded radiographically?  
A: The Kellgren–Lawrence grading system (0–4).

Q: What’s seen in mild OA on X-ray?  
A: Early osteophytes and slight joint space reduction.

Q: What’s seen in moderate OA?  
A: Definite narrowing, multiple osteophytes, and mild deformity.

Q: What’s seen in severe OA?  
A: Severe narrowing, large osteophytes, sclerosis, and bone deformity.

Q: What X-ray view is preferred for knee OA?  
A: Weight-bearing anteroposterior and lateral views show joint space accurately.

Q: Why weight-bearing view?  
A: It demonstrates cartilage loss under natural load.

Q: What is skyline or sunrise view used for?  
A: Assessing patellofemoral joint degeneration.

Q: What MRI findings correspond to OA?  
A: Cartilage thinning, bone marrow lesions, meniscal tears, and synovitis.

Q: Are osteophytes always visible on X-rays?  
A: Usually, but small or early ones may be missed without oblique views.

Q: What does "eburnation" mean?  
A: Bone polishing due to cartilage loss and bone-on-bone contact.

Q: What is bone marrow edema?  
A: Increased fluid within bone marrow seen on MRI in active OA.

Q: What are the compartments of the knee?  
A: Medial, lateral, and patellofemoral compartments.

Q: Which compartment is most affected in OA?  
A: The medial compartment due to higher load bearing.

Q: What radiographic feature correlates best with pain?  
A: Joint space narrowing correlates more than osteophyte size.

Q: What’s the advantage of MRI over X-ray?  
A: Detects early cartilage and soft tissue changes before bone changes.

Q: What is cartilage thinning?  
A: Reduction of cartilage layer thickness leading to bone exposure.

Q: What is a “bone spur”?  
A: Another term for osteophyte.

Q: What is varus deformity on imaging?  
A: Bow-legged appearance from medial joint collapse.

Q: What is valgus deformity on imaging?  
A: Knock-knee alignment from lateral compartment narrowing.

Q: Can ultrasound detect OA?  
A: It can visualize effusion, synovitis, and osteophytes but not deep cartilage.

Q: What is enthesophyte?  
A: Bony outgrowth at tendon or ligament attachment site.

Q: How does CT compare to MRI in OA?  
A: CT shows bone detail better; MRI shows cartilage and soft tissue.

Q: What is Kellgren–Lawrence grade 2?  
A: Definite osteophytes, possible joint space narrowing.

Q: What is the earliest X-ray sign of OA?  
A: Small osteophytes at joint margins.

Q: What is the latest X-ray change?  
A: Bone deformity and total joint space obliteration.

Q: Can OA occur without osteophytes?  
A: Yes, especially early or in inflammatory variants.

Q: What does joint effusion look like on imaging?  
A: Soft-tissue density bulging in suprapatellar region.

Q: What is sclerosis appearance on X-ray?  
A: Increased whiteness in subchondral bone.

Q: What is the hallmark of advanced OA?  
A: Bone-on-bone contact with large osteophytes and deformity.

Q: How can malalignment be quantified?  
A: By measuring mechanical axis deviation on full-leg radiograph.

Q: Can radiographs distinguish pain severity?  
A: Not precisely—radiographic severity doesn’t always match symptoms.

Q: What is chondrocalcinosis?  
A: Calcification in cartilage sometimes coexisting with OA.

Q: What’s the role of MRI T2 mapping?  
A: Detects cartilage composition changes before structural loss.

Q: What are bone cysts?  
A: Subchondral lucencies representing fluid-filled cavities.

Q: What’s the role of dual-energy CT?  
A: Differentiates crystal deposition diseases from OA.

Q: What are loose bodies in OA?  
A: Fragments of cartilage or bone within the joint space.

Q: What’s osteonecrosis and how does it differ?  
A: Bone death from poor blood supply; can mimic severe OA radiographically.

Q: What is meniscal extrusion?  
A: Displacement of meniscus beyond tibial margin, seen in OA MRI.

Q: How is cartilage thickness measured on MRI?  
A: By evaluating distance between bone surfaces in specific sequences.

Q: What does “joint space width” measure?  
A: Distance between femur and tibia representing cartilage health.

Q: What is tibial spine sclerosis?  
A: Increased bone density at tibial eminences seen in advanced OA.

Q: What is a “flattened femoral condyle”?  
A: Deformation of rounded bone surface due to chronic wear.

Q: What is joint incongruity?  
A: Misalignment of joint surfaces causing uneven load distribution.

Q: What is a periarticular osteophyte?  
A: Spur formation at the joint capsule attachment area.

Q: What is cystic change in OA?  
A: Subchondral bone cyst formation due to fluid intrusion.

Q: Why are both knees imaged?  
A: For comparison and detection of symmetrical or compensatory changes.

Q: Can early OA be missed on X-rays?  
A: Yes, because soft-tissue and cartilage changes appear only on MRI.

Q: What are radiolucent lines on X-rays?  
A: Darker areas indicating cartilage loss or cysts.

Q: What are radiopaque regions?  
A: Brighter regions representing sclerotic bone or osteophytes.

Q: What is the difference between degenerative and inflammatory arthritis on X-ray?  
A: OA shows asymmetric narrowing; inflammatory arthritis shows uniform loss and erosions.

Q: What does “tricompartmental OA” mean?  
A: OA affecting medial, lateral, and patellofemoral compartments.

Q: What is the tibiofemoral angle?  
A: The angle formed between femur and tibia, showing varus or valgus alignment.

Q: What is cartilage signal loss on MRI?  
A: Reduced brightness indicating degeneration or thinning.

Q: What is synovial hypertrophy?  
A: Thickening of the synovial membrane seen in advanced OA.

Q: What are “marginal osteophytes”?  
A: Bone spurs at the edge of the joint margin.

Q: What is a stress reaction on MRI?  
A: Edema-like signal in bone from increased mechanical loading.

Q: Can OA cause periarticular soft tissue swelling?  
A: Yes, due to synovial inflammation and effusion.

Q: What is the use of a Rosenberg view?  
A: It’s a 45° flexed PA view that enhances visualization of joint space loss.

Q: What is the purpose of grading OA radiographically?  
A: To standardize diagnosis, track progression, and guide treatment.

Q: What’s a hallmark MRI feature of OA?  
A: Cartilage defects combined with bone marrow lesions.

Q: Can radiographs detect meniscal tears?  
A: No, MRI is required for meniscal and ligamentous evaluation.

Q: What is “subchondral bone plate thickening”?  
A: A dense band of bone forming below cartilage due to chronic stress.

Q: Can ultrasound show cartilage thickness?  
A: Only for superficial areas, not deep tibiofemoral cartilage.

Q: Why might lateral compartment OA be underdiagnosed?  
A: Weight-bearing X-rays are often focused on the medial side.

Q: Can bone scans detect early OA?  
A: Yes, they show increased metabolic activity before radiographic changes.
