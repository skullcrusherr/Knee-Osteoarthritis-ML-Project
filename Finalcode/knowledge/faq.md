# Knee OA Basics
Q: What is knee osteoarthritis?
A: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage loss, osteophytes, and joint space narrowing seen on radiographs.

Q: What is the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grading system?
A: KL grading uses radiographic features to score severity from 0 to 4. Grade 0: none; 1: doubtful osteophytes; 2: definite osteophytes ± possible joint space narrowing; 3: multiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, possible deformity; 4: large osteophytes, severe narrowing, sclerosis, definite deformity.

# Imaging & Severity
Q: How do radiographs indicate OA?
A: Common findings: osteophytes, joint space narrowing (especially medial compartment), subchondral sclerosis/cysts, and malalignment.

Q: Are there pitfalls in automatic grading?
A: Yes—projection differences, hardware artifacts, and variable exposure. Always correlate with clinical context.

# Model & App
Q: What does this app predict?
A: This app predicts radiographic OA severity (either 0–4 or 3 buckets Healthy/Mild/Severe depending on training). It is a research tool, not a clinical device.

Q: How should predictions be interpreted?
A: As supportive information alongside clinical evaluation. Not a diagnosis.
